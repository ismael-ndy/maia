SESSION NOTES 

Patient name: Rene Descartes
Date: 24-12-2025

Notes:
Rene reported increased baseline anxiety this week, primarily related to work performance and upcoming deadlines. He described difficulty sleeping on two nights due to rumination about making mistakes and disappointing others. Mood was described as “on edge but manageable.”

Patient showed insight into his stress patterns and was able to identify a tendency toward catastrophizing. He responded positively to grounding exercises and cognitive reframing prompts. No indications of self-harm or acute risk expressed.

Suggested Focus for Next Session:

Explore perfectionism and fear of failure

Develop practical strategies for managing pre-sleep rumination

Reinforce coping tools that patient found effective this week
